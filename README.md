# Data Exercise

This data exercise represents an example of the type of data work we complete. We estimate that the exercise will take 2-3 hours to complete. Please use whatever statistical programming language, programming language, or data manipulation tool you are most comfortable with (SAS, R, SPSS, STATA, Python, SQL, etc).

This exercise will evaluate your ability to build a cohort of patients and calculate some metrics related to that cohort. You should have the following:

- [5 datasets](datasets) (all data you need is found within the provided datasets)
- [A data dictionary](data-dictionary.xlsx) defining each dataset and its fields

## Instructions

### Part 1: Assemble the project cohort

The project goal is to identify patients seen for drug overdose, determine if they had an active opioid at the time of the overdose, and if they had any readmissions for drug overdose.

Your task is to assemble the study cohort by identifying encounters that meet the following criteria:

1. The patient’s visit is an encounter for drug overdose
2. The hospital encounter occurs after July 15, 1999
3. The patient’s age at time of encounter is between 18 and 35 (Patient is considered to be 35 until turning 36)

### Part 2: Create additional fields

With your drug overdose encounter, create the following indicators:

1. `DEATH_AT_VISIT_IND`: `1` if patient died during the drug overdose encounter, `0` if the patient died at a different time
2. `COUNT_CURRENT_MEDS`: Count of active medications at the time of the drug overdose encounter
3. `CURRENT_OPIOID_IND`: `1` if the patient had at least one active medication at the time of the overdose encounter that is on the Opioids List (provided below)
4. `READMISSION_90_DAY_IND`: `1` if the visit resulted in a subsequent drug overdose readmission within 90 days, 0 if not 
5. `READMISSION_30_DAY_IND`: `1` if the visit resulted in a subsequent drug overdose readmission within 30 days, 0 if not overdose encounter, `0` if not
6. `FIRST_READMISSION_DATE`: The date of the index visit's first readmission for drug overdose. Field should be left as `N/A` if no readmission for drug overdose within 90 days

### Part 3: Export the data to a `CSV` file

Export a dataset containing these required fields:

| `DEATH_AT_VISIT_IND`      | Indicator if the patient died during the drug overdose encounter. Leave `N/A` if patient has not died,                             | 0 /1             |
| `COUNT_CURRENT_MEDS`      | Count of active medications at the time of the drug overdose encounter                          | Num              |
